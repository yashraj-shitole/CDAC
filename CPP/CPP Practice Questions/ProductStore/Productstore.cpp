//Product Store Simulation:
//Create a base class Product with attributes like ID, name, and price. Derive Electronics and Groceries classes with specific
//attributes (e.g., warranty, expiry date). Implement methods to calculate the total price,
//considering discounts (e.g., 10% for electronics, 5% for groceries). Make a menu-driven
//program to add/remove products, and generate a bill.
