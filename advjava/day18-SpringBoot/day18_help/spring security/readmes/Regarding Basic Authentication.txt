What is Basic Authentication scheme of HTTP?

1. Any time client sends a request to any protected resource -spring security uses by default : basic authentication
Meaning - It  sends resp header : WWW-Autheticate , with the realm=Basic 
2. Client has to send username:password using base64 encoding.
(Note - It can be automatically  sent by postman , using Basic Authentication scheme)
3. In case of successful , authentication , access to end point is given.


How Basic Auth processing is done by Spring Security ?
Ans - Using BasicAuthenticationFilter

It processes a HTTP request's BASIC authorization headers, putting the result into the SecurityContextHolder.

This filter is responsible for processing any request that has a HTTP request header of Authorization with an authentication scheme of Basic and a Base64-encoded username:password token
 

If authentication is successful, the resulting Authentication object will be placed into the SecurityContextHolder.


Basic authentication is an attractive protocol because it is simple and widely deployed. 
BUT  it still transmits a password in clear text so is undesirable in many situations.
