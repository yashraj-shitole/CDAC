Regarding orphanRemoval

What is orphanRemoval ?
A boolean property of @OneToMany / @OneToOne annotation.
default value - false

It states - 
Whether to apply the remove operation to entities that have been removed from the relationship and to cascade the remove operation to those entities.
We had already added - cascade=CascadeType.ALL (which includes - REMOVE)
BUT still it wasn't working.

So after enabling the orphanRemoval=true , after removing the post from the category 
(using removeBlogPost) , we are telling hibernate to remove the orphan post record .
