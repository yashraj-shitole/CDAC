Modes of wiring (D.I) suppoted by SC
1.Explicit wiring
Meaning prog has to supply - java code(setters | parameterized ctors | factory method)
+ xml configuration
1.1 Constructor Based D.I
Used for mandatory dependencies(i.e dependency is created first n then dependent)
1. In dependent bean class - add parameterized ctor (ard per /dependency)
2. In xml file
<constructor-arg name|type|index value|ref/> 
one per dependency
use value -for injecting prim types
use ref - for injecting depcy bean refs.

1.2 Setter based D.I
Used for optional dependencies(i.e dependent is created first n then dependency)
1. In dependent bean class - add a setter / per dependency
2. In xml file
<property name value|ref/> 
one per dependency
use value -for injecting prim types
use ref - for injecting depcy bean refs.

1.3 Factory method based D.I
SC can provide the dependecies even w/o any paramterized ctor or setters , using factory method
factory method=public static method returning bean instance
1. Add factory method in bean class
2. In xml 
add factory-method="nameOfFactroyMethod" attribute in the <bean> tag.
To supply args , to the factory method
 <constructor-arg name|type|index value|ref/>
