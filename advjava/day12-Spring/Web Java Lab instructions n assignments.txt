Day 8
1. Revise the development steps
2. You have already imported test_hibernate_basic.
Continue with the same

2.1 Create HibernateUtils to create session factory
2.2 Create Team POJO(Entity class)  for IPL team , for the following table n then add mapping entry.

 teams table -
team_id bigint primary key auto_increment,name varchar(100) unique ,abbreviation varchar(10) unique,owner varchar(20) not null,max_player_age int,
batting_avg double,wickets_taken int)

2.3 Create Team DAO interface n implementation class , for adding new IPL team

2.4. Write a Tester for this n test  it 

Day 9

1. import day9.1 in your workspace , as existing Maven Project 
Edit DB password
Force update Maven project

2. We will revise CRUD with user scenario

3. Hands on
3.1 Add multiple IPL teams in DB
3.2 Display all teams
3.3 Display all teams , requiring 
max age requirement of the player < specified age
batting average required > specified average
I/P - age n batting average

3.4 Display team owner names n team abbreviations
 requiring 
max age requirement of the player < specified age
batting average > specified average
I/P - age n batting average
o/p - list of teams

3.5 Update max age requirement
i/p - IPL team name
o/p - message (success | failure)

3.6 Delete team details
i/p - team id
o/p - message (success | failure)


Day 10
1. Install lombok JAR for your STS 3 IDE
(Refer - "day10-data\day10_help\readmes\Regarding Lombok.txt")
I will get all the steps done , but 
We will not spend too much time here.
If in case it doesn't work , continue by generating ctors , getters,setters , toString etc.

2. Revision
2.1 Copy n  import day10.2 in your workspace , as existing Maven Project 
Edit DB password
Force update Maven project
Maven - clean compile

2.2 We will revise advanced hibernate part here.
inheritance n associations


3. Hands on - Continue with your IPL assignment

3.1 Create BaseEntity -
add common fields 
id , creationDate, updatedOn

3.2 Update Team POJO (extends BaseEntity)

3.3 Create Player POJO 
for the players table 
Refer - 
players(id bigint primary key auto_increment,first_name varchar(20),last_name varchar(20),dob date,batting_avg double,wickets_taken int,team_id int ,constraint fk_teams foreign key (team_id) references teams(id)

3.4 Establish Team 1 <-----> * Player , a bi directional association between the entities.
Hint 
Use JPA annotations n mappedBy
Team - one , parent table , inverse
Player - many , child table , owning (FK)

Day 11
1. Revision
1.1 Copy n  import day11.1 (from last commit) in your workspace , as existing Maven Project 
Edit DB password
Force update Maven project
Maven - clean compile

1.2 Revise via code
all associations.

2. Add User 1----->1 AdhaarCard
(Entity - Composite Value Type)

3. Add User 1---->* Languages
private List<String> languages=newArrayList<>();
Configure it as Collection of basic value types.

Run TestHibernate , to understand

4. Solve 

4.1 Add Player to the team
i/p - player details (first_name,last_name, dob,batting_avg,wickets_taken) n team id
o/p a message (success or failure)
DB action - player record should be added with FK set.


4.2 Display team n player details (in a single join query)
i/p - team id
o/p - team + list of players displayed

4.3 Remove the player from team
i/p - team id , player id 
o/p - a message (success or failure)
DB action - player record should be reoved



Optional assignments for more practice

1. Configure uni directional association (from scratch) 

Comment *--->1 User(Commenter)
Comment * ---> BlogPost

Add required details in Entity layer 

2. Post new comment
i/p - comment text , rating , commenter(user) id n blog post id
o/p - a mesg indicating success or failure
DB action - new child record should get added in comments table.


3. Update Comment text n rating
i/p - comment id n new  text , new rating 
o/p - mesg


4. Delete all the comments by given commenter
i/p - commenter id
o/p - mesg (indicating how many comments were deleted)

5. Add New Tag
i/p - tag name)
o/p - created tag details indicating tag id

6. Assign post to the tag
i/p - tag name n post title
o/p - mesg

7. Remove the post from a tag.
i/p - tag id n post id
o/p - mesg

8. Assign user address
i/p - user id n address details
o/p - message

9. Display user address
i/p - user id
o/p - address details or error message

10. Display all the comments by specific commenter
i/p - commenter's email
o/p - list of comments


Day 12
1.Copy n  import day12.1 in your workspace.
Force update Maven project
Run Maven goals - clean compile

1.1 Revise spring bean life cycle
1.2 Constructor based D.I

2. Copy n  import day12.2 in your workspace.
Force update Maven project
2.1  Setter based D.I

3. Use factory based D.I , to inject 
subject teacher in public school.

4. Revise Hibernate association 
one-one (User 1--->1 Address)

4.1 Solve 
Assign user address
i/p - user id n address details
o/p - message

5. Link Adhaar Card details to user 
i/p - user id n adhaar card details
o/p - message

6. Optional Exercise (for more practice)
Establish uni dir association in IPL scenario
Owner 1---->1 Team
What will you add in Owner ?
What will you add/remove from Team ?
Confirm auto table creation
