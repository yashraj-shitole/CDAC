It is widely used in the industry to build, test, and consume APIs, supplying better communication and collaboration between development teams.

Swagger:
 Swagger is a collection of open-source tools(eg. swagger-ui) that support this specification and provide additional functionalities like API documentation and code generation.
Swagger is an open-source set of tools built around the OpenAPI Specification.
