Spring boot allows easy integration with  testing frameworks : JUnit 5(Jupiter) n Mockito.
 
Regarding Spring Boot Testing (Data Layer)

Spring Boot provides the @DataJpaTest annotation to test the persistence layer components.

It scans the @Entity classes and Spring Data JPA repositories.

Sets the spring.jpa.show-sql property to true and enable the SQL queries logging.

By Default, JPA test data are transactional and roll back at the end of each test; it means we do not need to clean up saved or modified table data after each test.

Replace the application data source, run and configure the embedded database (in memory eg : H2) on run time classpath(build path)


By default they will autoconfigure in-memory embedded database for testing purposes.
eg H2 database | HSQL

But if you don't want to replace your original database by test database ,use
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = Replace.NONE)

Since test cases should not modify the state of DB , by default rollback is applied after the execution of test cases.

But , since we wanted to write test cases to insert the recs in emps table , marked 
@Rollback(false)

@DataJpaTest annotation doesnâ€™t load other Spring beans (@Components, @Controller, @Service, and annotated beans) into ApplicationContext(SC) 

By default, it scans for @Entity classes and configures Spring Data JPA repositories annotated with @Repository annotation.

2. Spring Boot provides 
2.1 @SpringBootTest for integration testing
(eg : service +dao + DB)

2.2 Using TestRestTemplate - for conroller + service +dao + DB
end - to -end testing
