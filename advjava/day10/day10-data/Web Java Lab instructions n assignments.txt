We will not spend too much time here.
If in case it doesn't work , continue by generating ctors , getters,setters , toString etc.

Edit DB password
Force update Maven project
Maven - clean compile

2.2 We will revise advanced hibernate part here.
inheritance n associations


3. Hands on - Continue with your IPL assignment

3.1 Create BaseEntity -
